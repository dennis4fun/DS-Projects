## Sample CI Project with Data Science Elements

## ðŸ“¦ Python Environment Setup with Pipenv

This project uses [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) for streamlined dependency management and isolated virtual environments, ensuring our development setup is always consistent.

Prerequisites
To get started, make sure you have pipenv installed on your system:

```bash
pip install --user pipenv
```

Getting Started (For Cloned Repositories)

If you've just cloned this repository, navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
pipenv install
```

This command will automatically create the necessary virtual environment and install all project dependencies as specified in the `Pipfile.lock` file.
